Using biomass as a source of fuel can have environmental benefits. When biomass is burned, it releases carbon dioxide, but the carbon dioxide released is offset by the carbon dioxide absorbed by the plants during their growth, making it a carbon-neutral fuel source. Additionally, using biomass for fuel can reduce the reliance on non-renewable fossil fuels, which can help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
