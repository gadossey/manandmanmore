Climate change is one of the most pressing issues of our time, and it is closely linked to deforestation. As forests are cleared, the carbon stored in the trees is released into the atmosphere, contributing to global warming.

Deforestation is a major contributor to climate change. According to the World Resources Institute, deforestation accounts for up to 15 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions.

This is because trees absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and store it in their trunks, branches, and leaves.
Hence, Man & Man Enterprise, our goal is to reduce atmospheric carbon as much as possible.
We have so far been successful in implementing two carbon initiatives that have reduced CO2 emissions by more than 400,000 tonnes annually.
